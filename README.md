This is a public repository with some notebooks to show our work:

- Metrics_GITHUB: how we calculated our confidence intervals with boostraping.
- Visualizing FPs and FNs: how to visualize wrongly flagged images.
- Age_and_sex_distribution: how we analyzed the different distribution of age and sex in our study cohort.
